I want to create a social platform that values equality.

You are not allowed to create a post unless you have responded to a previous post in your feed.

The idea is to equally divide engagement since so many people don't engage equally.

Need a way to validate if a response to a post is relevant to the initial post.

Essentially can be what facebook is, a user profile with a wall of posts, the feed is only your friends, this isn't supposed to be anything more than that.

Share thoughts and ideas, how your feeling, what are you doing in that moment, what are you looking to do, etc.

ex. beautiful women tend to get way more attention then men. forums are rigid and people tend to be asshole, but I want to foster engagement in a way that's never been seen before. The amount of people seeking attention has never been hire. Everyone deserves to be heard.
